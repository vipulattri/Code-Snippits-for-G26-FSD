# Bewakoof.com Clone Website

This project is a clone of the popular e-commerce website Bewakoof.com, developed using ReactJS and integrated with two fake APIs to simulate a real-world online shopping experience. The project showcases various features such as product listing, dynamic loading of product data, and a responsive design.

## Features

- **Product Listing**: Displays a variety of products with images, titles, and prices.
- **Responsive Design**: The website adapts to various screen sizes, providing a seamless experience on both mobile and desktop devices.
- **Fake API Integration**: Utilizes two fake APIs to fetch product data:
  - [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/products)
  - [Dummy JSON API](https://dummyjson.com/products)
- **Live Demo**: A deployed version of the website is available for live testing.

## Installation Instructions

To run the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ecom-clone.git
    cd ecom-clone
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Run the project**:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

4. **Open the website** in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## How It Works

1. The product data is fetched from two APIs: [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/products) and [Dummy JSON API](https://dummyjson.com/products).
2. React components are used to render the product data dynamically, ensuring that the page is updated whenever new data is available.
3. The user interface is responsive, meaning it adjusts to different screen sizes for an optimal experience on mobile, tablet, or desktop devices.
